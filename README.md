# Mini SOC with Wazuh on Docker Swarm

A miniature Security Operations Center (SOC) environment built with Wazuh SIEM deployed on a Docker Swarm cluster. This project demonstrates infrastructure automation with Ansible, container orchestration, and security monitoring capabilities.

##  Features

- **Containerized Wazuh Stack**: Deploys Wazuh Indexer, Manager, and Dashboard using Docker
- **Docker Swarm Orchestration**: Utilizes swarm mode for high availability
- **Automated Deployment**: Ansible playbooks for provisioning and teardown
- **Reverse Proxy & SSL**: Traefik with SSL termination for secure access
- **Custom Detection Rules**: Implemented SSH brute force detection logic
- **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub repository structure supports automation

##  Architecture

The solution consists of a Docker Swarm cluster running:

- Wazuh Indexer (OpenSearch)
- Wazuh Manager
- Wazuh Dashboard
- Traefik (reverse proxy with SSL)
- Automated with Ansible playbooks

##  Installation
